"""The RunFlow MCP server — RunFlow as a Claude app connector.

Mounted into the FastAPI app at a path containing a shared secret, because
Claude app custom connectors accept only authless or OAuth servers: there is no
field for a bearer token or a custom header. The mount path *is* the credential.

Scope is read + trigger-sync. Nothing here writes training data.
